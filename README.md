# XNL REAL‑TIME FINANCIAL DATA PROCESSING & EVENT‑DRIVEN API DEVELOPMENT
The Ethereum Deposit Tracker is an advanced application designed to monitor and record ETH deposits made to the Beacon Deposit Contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It seamlessly connects to an Ethereum node using Infura or Alchemy to track deposits in real time, ensuring accurate logging of transactions. The system captures essential details such as block number, timestamp, transaction hash, and more while providing optional Telegram notifications for real-time alerts. Built with a scalable and extendable architecture, the tracker can be further enhanced with visualization tools like Grafana or integrated with a database for deeper insights. To streamline deployment, the project is also Dockerized, making it easy to deploy in various environments.

Before getting started, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You will need Node.js (version 12.x or higher), npm (Node Package Manager), and access to an Ethereum RPC provider like Infura or Alchemy. Additionally, you can set up an optional Telegram bot to receive deposit alerts and use Docker for containerized deployment.

To begin, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory by running git clone https://github.com/parthhiv-pathakk/XNL.git followed by cd XNL. After this, install the backend dependencies using npm install. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the backend by navigating to the eth-deposit-tracker directory and executing node server.js. This will initialize the backend server on port 3001, where it continuously monitors Ethereum blocks and logs deposits made to the Beacon Deposit Contract.

For the frontend setup, move to the eth-deposit-frontend directory using cd ../eth-deposit-frontend, install the necessary frontend dependencies using npm install, and then start the frontend development server by running npm start. The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3001, fetching deposit data from the backend at http://localhost:3001/deposits and displaying it in a structured table format.

To run the complete project, first, start the backend by navigating to the eth-deposit-tracker directory and executing node server.js. This will ensure that the system continuously tracks Ethereum blocks in real-time, logs detected deposits to deposits.log, and serves deposit data at http://localhost:3001/deposits. Next, start the frontend by opening a new terminal window, navigating to the eth-deposit-frontend directory, and running npm start. The frontend will launch and be available at http://localhost:3001, displaying real-time deposit data fetched from the backend. This streamlined architecture ensures efficient real-time financial data processing, making it a reliable solution for tracking Ethereum deposits with an event-driven approach.
